 * Questions
 * 
 * El-Khadrawy is well-known across the globe for his love of graph problems, or as he calls them, "graphs".
 * Therefore, he couldn't miss the chance of setting a graph problem for his dear participants from Egypt.
 * In this problem, El-Khadrawy will give you a graph of N nodes. However, this graph doesn't contain any edges yet.
 * Next, El-Khadrawy asks you to add exactly N directed edges to this graph,
 * such that each node gets exactly one edge that starts from it. In addition, EI-Khadrawy will give you an integer C.
 * He asks you to count the number of ways to add the N edges, such that the resulting graph contains exactly C simple cycles.
 * Recall that a simple cycle is the one that starts from some node u, and by following the edges we can rcach back to u.
 * El-Khadrawy likes to make his problems tricky. So, for this problem, he told you that you are allowed to make self-loops.
 * In other words, you can have an edge that starts from some node u and ends at u itself. Since the number of ways can be very large,
 * print it modulo 10Â° + 7.
 * Two ways are considered different if the first one contains at least one edge that is not presented in the other.
 * 
 * 
 * Input 
 * 
 * 
 * The first line contains an integer T  denoting the number of test cases.
 * Each test case contains two integers N and C  denoting the number of nodes,
 * and the number of required simple cycles respectively. 
 * 
 * Output
 * 
 * For each test case print a single line containing a single integer denoting the answer to the problem.
